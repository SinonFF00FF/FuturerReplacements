# FuturerReplacements

stuff that will someday be SM_ICT.2 (or SM_IAVCT)

some stuff is not finished and maybe I have not included some of my own modles you would need to run some func/mehtods

P.S. I did tested only some stuff form the snn_CM file so maybe some stuff doesnt work

P.S.2 I use Python 3.8 so maybe some stuff breaks in futuere version of python (I idk if it does I didnt tested it with other compilers)
